Generic Keyboard controller
================
Version 0.5a (WIP) 

Generic Keyboard controller. Handles an internal buffer to store key events.

- Device Class    : 0x03 (HID)
- Device Build    : 0xXXXX
- Device ID       : 0x0001 (Generic Keyboard)
- Device Version  : 0xXXXX


RESOURCES
---------

The keyboard controller uses few registers to see the status of the keyboard, the key buffer and send commands, plus can throw a interrupt. The address of the registers and interrupt message are gave by Hardware Enumerator.

- Address block of 3 bytes
- Interrupt KeyEvent

In the address block are this registers :

- KEY_REG (Read/Write a word) at offset 0
- KEY_CMD (Read/Write a byte) at offset 2

HOW WORKS
---------

The Keyboard controller have a internal ring buffer that stores a "keyboard event" when a user types a key. Each entry of the buffer contains information of the key pressed and if was any function key pressed at same time. Also, there is two types of entries in the buffer: RAW events and KEY events.

**RAW** events uses **scancodes** that represents what physical physical key was pressed. This scancodes are usually refereed against a US English keyboard for reference. For example scancode 0x02F is the key that in a US keyboard is a semicolon symbol, so we call these key "semicolon".

**KEY** events returns a [Latin-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) (8bit ASCII) representation of the key pressed and apply on it effects like Shift, uppercasing, localization of the keyboard layout (for example : 'ñ' or 'ç'), etc...

KEY events are more useful for basic typing commands or text, when RAW events are more useful if you need to do actions with keys in a particular position.

Also, there is there modes of operation in the keyboard controller : RAW mode, KEY mode, and RAW+KEY mode. In RAW mode, each time that a user type a key in the keyboard, only push in the buffer a RAW events. In KEY mode, each time that a user type a key in the keyboard, only push in the buffer a KEY event. And finally, in RAW+KEY mode, each time that a user type in the keyboard, only push a RAW event followed by a KEY event.

OPERATION
---------

Reading at KEY_REG, gets the last event.
Reading value from KEY_CMD depends of the command.

Writing at KEY_REG, push a event to the keyboard buffer
Writing at KEY_CMD, sends a command to the keyboard.

### Commands

Accepted values to write in KEY_CMD are in this list :

     VALUE |  NAME      | BEHAVIOUR
    -------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------
      0x00 | CLEAR      | Clear keyboard buffer
      0x01 | COUNT      | Reading KEY_CMD returns the number of events stored in
           |            | the buffer when the command is send.
      0x02 | D-INT      | Disables interrupt when a Key event happens.
      0x03 | E-INT      | Enables interrupts when a Key event happens.
      0x04 | KEY-MODE   | Switch to KEY mode.
      0x05 | RAW-MODE   | Switch to RAW mode.
      0x06 | RK-MODE    | Switch to RAW+KEY mode.
    -------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------

### Events

If interrupts are enabled, the keyboard will trigger an interrupt when a keyboard event happens.

RAW Event Format (value read from KEY_REG):

    15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
    ----------------------------------------------
    1  G  C  S  X  X  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s
    
Where : 

 - G (Alt Gr mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Alt Gr Key is being pressed at same time
 - C (Control mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Control Key is being pressed at same time
 - S (Shift mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Shift Key is being pressed at same time
 - X reserved for future use
 - ssssssssss 10 bit scancode
 
 
KEY Event Format (value read from KEY_REG):

    15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
    ----------------------------------------------
    0  G  C  S  X  X  0  0  k  k  k  k  k  k  k  k

Where : 

 - G (Alt Gr mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Alt Gr Key is being pressed at same time
 - C (Control mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Control Key is being pressed at same time
 - S (Shift mod) If the bit is set to 1, this means that the Shift Key is being pressed at same time
 - X reserved for future use
 - kkkkkkkk Latin-1 representation of the key. 


### Events buffer
The buffer can store at least 64 events. Each time that a key is typed, the appropriate event is pushed to the buffer.
The buffer operates in FIFO fashion. So when a user types a key, a new event is inserted in the buffer. Reading KEY_REG, extracts the most old event stored in the buffer (POP buffer). But writing to KEY_REG, inserts a new event in the buffer like if was the oldest entry, in other words, PUSH a event to the buffer. Pushing could be do only, if the buffer have enough size to store it. If there is not enight space, then pushing fails silent. When the buffer fills and the keyboard inserts a new event, the most oldest event is removed to allow to insert the new event.

                       |---|
